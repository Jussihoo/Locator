# Locator

The idea of this project is to implement a web application, which shows multiple locate objects / persons on a map, which can be public or private.
And the movement of these objects as well their route is shown realtime without any user actions on map (several different map tile options) with additional
information like route length, current speed, average speed etc. There will be many of such maps. The route of each locate objects can be saved as
a gpx-file if wanted. This file can be then later on imported to services like Sports Tracker etc.

The location of these objects can be sent via devices like Thingsee, web application running on phone or native Android (maybe other OS later) application.

There will be also social media connectivity. THis service can be used for multiple purposes, both professional purposes (tracking fleet etc.)
or for fun like for tracking the racers / runners etc. in different competitions. Or used for virtual orienteering purposes where the control
points could be purely virtual or virtual in addition to the real control points. The possibilities are quite big.
